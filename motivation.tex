\section{Motivation}
The ImageNet competition has led to significant advancements in exploring various architectural
choices in CNNs, such as AlexNet, VGGNet, InceptionNet and ResNets, and the layers of model has increased from
8 to 1000 plus. As the researchers constantly push the boundary of the prediction accuracy, the model size
and depth


Behind the excellent performance of these CNNs models is the great computing power
