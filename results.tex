\subsection{Compare to Oracle}


\subsection{Analysis}
The bar-plot in Figure~\ref{fig:analy_quan} and Figure~\ref{fig:analy_prun}
shows the difference before and after using two compress techiniques respectively.


\cparagraph{Model size.}
Figure ~\ref{fig:analy_quan} a
compares the ten model size before and after using the \quantization.
As we can see from this figure, the Inception\_v1 model is
compressed from 26.1 MB to 6.8MB, which 
owns the largest compression radio, with 27.1\%.
On average, the \quantization reduces the model size by 74.5\%, 
as the relative sparse index is encoded with 8 bits, resulting in 
xxx compression in total.




\cparagraph{Energy consumption.}
Energy consumption is dominated by memory access
