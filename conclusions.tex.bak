\section{Conclusions}
This paper has presented an automatic approach to optimize the mobile web
rendering process on heterogeneous mobile platforms, providing a significant
performance improvement over the Linux interactive governor. At the heart
of our approach is a machine learning based model that provides an accurate
prediction of the optimal processor configuration to use to run the web
browser rendering process, taking into account the web workload
characteristics and the optimization goal. Our approach is implemented as an
extension in the Google Chromium web browser and evaluated on a
representative ARM big.LITTLE mobile platform for three distinct metrics.
Experiments performed on the 500 hottest websites show that our approach achieves over 80\% of the oracle performance.
It
achieves over 40\% improvement over the Linux default policy
across three evaluation metrics: load time, energy consumption and the energy delay product.
It
consistently outperforms a state-of-the-art webpage-aware scheduling mechanism.
In future work, we intend to explore further refinement to prediction accuracy, and also to exploit the network delay to perform optimizations.
