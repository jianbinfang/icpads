\section{Experimental Setup \label{sec:setup}}
NVIDIA Jetson TX2 is NVIDIA¡¯s second-generation CUDA-capable
edge device. Like its predecessor, TX1, TX2 runs
Linux using a quad-core ARM CPU. It is equipped with
an NVIDIA Pascal GPU , which contains specialized
architecture for AI applications. TX2 has 8 GB of LPDDR4
RAM and supports PCIe2.0 and various peripherals such
as UART, GPIOs, HDMI, USB 3.0 and 2.0, Ethernet, and
802.11ac WLAN. NVIDIA provides the required drivers and
CUDA toolkits for TX2 via the JetPack SDK.
