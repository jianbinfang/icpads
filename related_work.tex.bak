\section{Related Work}
Our work lies at the intersection of multiple research areas: web browsing optimization, task scheduling, energy optimization and predictive modeling. There is no existing work that is similar to ours, in respect to optimizing web workloads across multiple optimization objectives on heterogeneous mobile platforms.

\paragraph*{Web Browsing Optimization}
A number of techniques have been proposed to optimize web browsing, through e.g. prefetching~\cite{wang2012far} and caching~\cite{xu2004caching,qian2012web} web contents, scheduling network requests~\cite{qian2014characterizing},
or re-constructing the web browser workflow~\cite{zhao2015energy,mai2012case}.
Most of the prior work are built for a homogeneous  mobile systems where the processors are identical. Furthermore, prior work often targets one single optimization goal (either performance or energy consumption).
Unlike previous research, our work targets a heterogeneous mobile system with different processing units and  multiple
optimization goals.
The work presented by Zhu \emph{et al.}~\cite{YZhu13} is the nearest work,
which uses linear regression models to estimate the load time and energy
consumption for each web event to determine where to run the rendering
process. While promising, there are two significant shortcomings with this
approach. Firstly, it schedules the webpage to the big core with
the highest frequency if no configuration meets the cut-off
latency. This leads to bad performance as can be
seen in Section~\ref{sec:network_environment} in poor network environment,
because the network but
not the processor is the bottleneck, a lot energy would be wasted with such a high performance configuration.
This approach thus will miss
many optimization opportunities by ignoring the different download speeds in different network environments. Secondly, their linear regression
models only capture the linear correlation between the web workload
characteristics and the processor configuration, leading to a poor prediction
accuracy for some webpages. Our work addresses both of these issues by
dynamically configuring all CPU cores of the system and modelling both linear
and non-linear behavior. Therefore, our approach achieves better
performance in heterogeneous hardware systems.

%work exploits xx. This is different from prior work that tackles xxx.;
%We advance prior work on xxx.
%;

\paragraph*{Task Scheduling}
There is an extensive body of work on scheduling application tasks on homogeneous and heterogeneous multi-core systems
~\cite{mohapatra1996line,zhang2002task,eyerman2010probabilistic,augonnet2011starpu,singh2013mapping}.
Most of the prior work in the area use heuristics or analytical models to
determine which processor to use to run an application task, by exploiting
the code or runtime information of the program. Our approach targets a
different domain by using the web workload characteristics to optimize mobile
web browsing for a number of optimization metrics.

%There has been a significant amount of prior work investigating hardware and operating
%system based approaches to schedule multiple tasks on CPUs.
%We consider a more comprehensive perspective to evaluate the the web browsing
%in heterogeneous platform.
%This is different from prior work that tackles on the load balancing, turnaround time or eliminate
%communication costs between processors. And
%all those schemes require runtime
%profiling or searching to determine a scheduling plan,
%which may incur significant runtime overhead.
%We perform the render process scheduling with similar capabilities
%as \cite{YZhu13}, but we make full use of multi-process architecture for chromium,
%which previous work relied on the single process mode firefox.

\paragraph*{Energy Optimization}
Many techniques have been proposed to optimize web browsing via
application-level optimization, such as aggregating data
traffic~\cite{hu2014energy}, bundling HTTP
requests~\cite{li2016automated}, and exploiting the radio state
mechanism~\cite{zhao2011reducing}. Our approach
targets a lower level, by exploiting the heterogeneous hardware architecture
to perform energy optimization. Prior work on application-level optimization
is thus complementary to our work. Some research works characterize the
energy behaviour of web
workloads~\cite{d2016energy,thiagarajan2012killed,nicoara2015system}, which are orthogonal to our work.


\paragraph*{Predictive Modeling}
Machine learning based predictive modelling is rapidly
emerging as a viable way for systems optimisation.
Recent studies have shown that this technique is effective in predicting
power consumption~ \cite{shye2009into}, estimating the quality of
service~\cite{berral2011adaptive}, configuring processors using
DVFS~\cite{kan2012eclass}, and grouping communication traffics to reduce
power consumption~\cite{tang2015energy}. No work so far in the area has used
machine learning to predict the optimal processor configuration for mobile web browsing on heterogeneous mobile platforms across optimization goals. This work is the first to do so.

%Machine learning based predictive
%modeling has been proven to be effective at learning
%how to reduce the system overhead\cite{shye2009into,berral2011adaptive,kan2012eclass}.
%Shye et al.\cite{shye2009into} proposed a linear regression model
%that accurately predict the power consumption of a mobile architecture to
%reduce the overhead from screen and
%CPU.  J. L. Berral et al.\cite{berral2011adaptive} used the machine learning
%to estimate the resource usage and task service-level-agreement to
%to find good task scheduling that balance the revenue for executed tasks, quality of
%service, and power consumption in the data center.
%Kan et al.\cite{kan2012eclass} presented
%an energy-aware frequency assignment algorithm for DVFS
%processors, which is a classification-based approach to predict the optimal frequency for next interval.
%And Z. Tang et al.\cite{tang2015energy} described a machine learning based online scheduling
%that reduces the tail energy by deferring transmissions.
%However, none of the previous
%research in predictive modeling based application optimization
%addresses the problem of multi-task scheduling on a
%heterogeneous platform.
%The Zhu\cite{YZhu13} used off-line profiling to create a
%regression model that is employed to predict the webpage load time
%and energy, then map the webpage to the lower energy configuration
%that the load time within a limit value.
%Unlike Zhu, our approach uses SVM to predict the best configuration directly,
%and map the render process depends on what metrics to use.
