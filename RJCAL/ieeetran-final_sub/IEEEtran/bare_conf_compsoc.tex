\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we propose a machine
learning based approach to predict which of the heterogeneous processors to use to render the web content and the operating frequencies of heterogeneous processors.
We do so by first learning, \emph{offline}, a set of predictive models for a range of networking
environments. We then choose a learnt model at runtime to predict the optimal processor configuration. The prediction is based on the web content, the network status and the optimization goal.
We obtain, on average, over 21\% and 39\%
of improvement respectively for load time and energy consumption, when compared to two competitive
optimisers that are specifically tuned for mobile web browsing.
