\section{Conclusions}

This paper has presented an automatic approach to optimize web rendering on heterogeneous mobile platforms, providing significant
improvement over existing web-content-aware schedulers. We show that it is crucial to exploit the knowledge of the communication network
and the web contents to make effective scheduling decisions. We address the problem by using machine learning to develop predictive models
to predict which processor core to use to run the web rendering process and the optimum frequency of the processors. As a departure from
prior work, our approach consider of the network status, web workloads and the optimization goals. Our techniques are implemented as an
extension in the Chromium web browser and evaluated on a representative big.LITTLE heterogeneous mobile platform using the top 1000 hottest
websites. Experimental results show that our approach achieves over 80\% of the \oracle performance, and outperforms the state-of-the-arts
by 1.21x and 1.39x for load time and energy consumption.
